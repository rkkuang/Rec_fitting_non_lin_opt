# Rec_fitting_non_lin_opt
Matlab codes for rectangle fitting with nonlinear optimization method

Rectangle fitting from a set of discrete edge points by constructing a continuous cost function and using optimization method.

Simply run scripts simu_rec_fit_test.m and experimental_rec_fit.m

%The simu_rec_fit_test.m script is used to test the rectangle fitting
%method by first generating a simulated image with a rectangle region in
%it, then compute the parameters of that rectangle to test the locating 
%and size measuring accuracy of this method.

%The experimental_rec_fit.m script is used to show the experimental results
%of the locating and size measuring of micro work pieces.
