Matlab codes (simulation and experimental) for rectangle fitting with nonlinear optimization method

Rectangle fitting from a set of discrete edge points by constructing a continuous cost function and using optimization method.

Simply run scripts simulation.m and experimental_rec_fit.m

%The simulation.m script is used to test the rectangle fitting method by first generating a simulated image with a rectangle region in it, then compute the parameters of that rectangle to test the locating and size measuring accuracy of this method.

%The experimental_rec_fit.m script is used to show the experimental results of the locating and size measuring of micro work pieces.
